Came up with this little #guitar solo today:

It's mostly unedited, but I did flub the very last part lol so that last chord is from another take.
Drums + bass from my TRIO guitar pedal and backing guitar was recorded on the pedal's built-in looper.

I think I plagiarized part of this from the vocal track of a song... I can't tell if I just listened to it too many times, but the melody has started to sound really familiar and it's sus that it has a lot of repeat notes which is very common in vocal melodies but not in guitar solos.
