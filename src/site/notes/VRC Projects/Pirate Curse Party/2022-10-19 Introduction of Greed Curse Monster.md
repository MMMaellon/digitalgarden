[FaxMashine](faxmashine.com) Said the map reminded him of  [Forgotten Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffGBsLKhD40) which also takes place on a pirate's ship, but there are no imposters and every player has their own goals that they can choose to prioritize over the goal of the ship.

I wrote this comment in response:
> I really liked the idea of having to balance being selfish vs working as a team. I don't want to track stats or anything complicated like what Forgotten Waters is doing, so I'm thinking of reworking the way the curse works.
> The curse will be a personification of greed (maybe a talking treasure chest or something) who needs to be fed gold every day or else it begins killing people. Players will earn gold from the daily minigames and have to choose between hoarding it for themselves and adding to the public pool to feed the Greed Curse monster thing. When the Greed Curse doesn't get enough from its daily tribute, it'll start gobbling up gold from every player's secret stash until the poorest player can't pay anymore and is eaten alive.
> Instead of imposters, I'll have the curse offer deals to the players every few turns because it's scared of dying if the ship reaches the destination. Something like if you accept the deal, you get paid a ton of gold every time someone dies in the next 3 turns. Who accepts the deal will be hidden, but the number of people who accept is visible to everyone, and if you're accused of accepting and you did, you have to walk the plank

Name was originally __RotHeart's Pirate Curse__ but I think I'll change it to __Pirate Curse Party__. Mainly because I just finished watching a Mario Party game and think my game needs to advertise itself as a party game like that.
