# The Painted Prince

## Story
Once upon a time, there was a magical painter could create anything out of paint. He created food for the hungry, clothes for the cold, and toys for the children of the village in which he resided. The gifts he gave were just like the real thing except they washed away in the rain. But the painter was always happy to paint the villagers more gifts, for he was a kind and generous man.

To show their gratitude, the villagers gave the painter a set of paintbrushes made with hair from the village horses and wood from the village trees. It didn't paint as well as his magic paintbrush, but the painter could tell it was made with love. He graciously accepted the gift and promised he'd use it if he ever lost his magic paintbrush.

The painter was always looking to perfect his craft, and he was always trying to make more and more complex paintings. He painted an axe that could cut through any tree, a piano that could play any melody, and even a working lamp. One day, the painter painted himself a little boy that was his pride and joy.

The magical painter gave the little boy everything, for he was a kind and generous man. But the boy seemed to have an insatiable appetite and always asked for more.

The painter gave him toys, a pony, ice cream and pizza for every meal, but the little boy wanted more. He gave him a bicycle, an electric guitar, a rocket ship that could travel to the moon, but the little boy still wanted more. One day, the little boy asked for a castle, and butlers and servants, and a crown so he could declare himself "The Painted Prince". The painter was happy to oblige, for he was a kind and generous man.

The villagers, however, were less excited about the new castle that towered over them, and didn't want to be ruled by the little boy. Upset, the little boy turned to the painter and asked for an army with which he could rule over villagers. For the first time ever, the painter refused.

Before the painter knew what was happening, the little boy grabbed the paintbrush out of his hand and painted guards to seize the painter. The little boy's guards were crudely drawn and horribly misshapen, but they still obeyed and threw the painter into the dungeon.

The painter's heart was broken. He watched though the bars on his cell window as the Painted Prince used the power of the magic paintbrush to take over the village. With a heavy heart, the painter reached into his robe and pulled out the villagers' gift to him.

## Gameplay
The game starts with the player playing as the painter in the dungeon cell. They find the paintbrush from the villagers and use it to escape the dungeon and solve various puzzles on their way to the top of the Painted Prince's tower.

Most of the castle is shades of grey, but where ever there is a splash of paint the player can use their magic paintbrush to paint something into an existence such as a platform or a key to a door. Some objects share paint with others, so when you paint one object in, the other one disappears. Some objects can only be painted if the color on your brush matches that of the object. And all painted objects disappear if they come in contact with rain or water.

There are 4 towers that have to be completed to unlock the 5th and final tower. In various places in each tower are little paintings that tell the backstory of the painter and the Painted Prince.

### The Dungeon Tower
The first tower is the tutorial level. The player is introduced to the paint mechanics and has pretty simple puzzles to solve to reach the top. They are introduced to the paint sharing mechanic here and also to the idea of traps. Anything that gets painted in becomes interactable including an iron maiden trap in one of the dungeon's torture rooms. If a player paints in the iron maiden, it closes on them and they respawn at the start of the level. Once players reach the top of the tower, a stair case paints down to the courtyard. From the courtyard the player can reach the other towers including the final tower which is in the center of the courtyard. The final tower has a lock on its door that requires keys from all the different towers to unlock.

### The Rain Tower
It's raining heavily outside. Various cracks and gaps in the stone of the rain tower allow for curtains of water to fall around the player who has solve more difficult puzzles where platforms sometimes get washed away.

### The Paint Mixing Tower
In this tower, objects come in many different colors and players have to mix paints to match the color of the object they want to paint in.

### The Timing Tower
Paint takes time to paint in. This tower's gimmick is all about using that to make platforming more difficult.

### The BOSS Tower
In the final tower, you have to fight the Painted Prince. There's no dialog. You just see a figure made of red paint sitting on a throne. He gets up when you walk in and begins a fight where he can paint into existence knives and spears that get thrown at the player. The fight ends when the player gets close enough to sample the Painted Prince's paint and draw their own knives. They have to do this 3 times, and after each time the Painted Prince seems to heal himself and change his attack patterns. On the final attack, instead of painting in a knife, the player paints in a rocket that blows up the ceiling, letting in the rain. The Painted Prince washes away as do all the other props in the game. The game over screen takes place in front of a huge mural of the painter with the happy villagers.

## Status
Map is currently in development. Most of the coding is done. Octuplex is working on modeling, but development has slowed since various real life things (both for me and him) got in the way.

Hoping to pick up again at the start of November.
